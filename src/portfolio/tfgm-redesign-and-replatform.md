At the point I left TfGM, we were looking to refresh the design and infrastructure for TfGM.com and address pain points
around our deployment pipelines and our content management system.

I created some prototypes to better understand these problems and ran sessions with my team to explore some of the
approaches we could take.

These prototypes are publicly available on GitHub:

- [Larva](https://github.com/marchie/larva) - a prototype use of AWS CDK Pipelines, deploying across multiple AWS
  accounts.
- [Honeycomb](https://github.com/marchie/honeycomb) - a prototype tool for setting up Contentful in an automated way.
